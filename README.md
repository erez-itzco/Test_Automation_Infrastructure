## This project was developed to showcase my expertise in automation testing across multiple platforms and technologies.


## 📌 Project Summary

The project demonstrates a robust, scalable automation infrastructure designed with a modular and hierarchical architecture. Each module consists of multiple classes and methods, organized into common, helper, action, and page object layers. This structure allows test cases to be written with minimal code while maintaining flexibility and reusability across different application types.

One of the key strengths of the framework is its ease of maintenance and adaptability to various testing scenarios.

## 🧩 Key Features & Technologies:

✅ Page Object Model (POM) architecture

✅ Modular design with layered architecture (Extensions, Workflows, Test Cases)

✅ Support for multiple platforms and application types:

* Web applications

* Mobile apps

* Web APIs

* Electron-based apps

* Windows desktop applications

✅ Built-in failure handling mechanisms

✅ Centralized common functionality

✅ Integration with external configuration/data files

✅ Advanced reporting system with screenshot capture

✅ Visual testing support

✅ Database validation support

✅ CI/CD integration for scalable execution

🧪 Applications Used in Testing:

🌐 Grafana Web – Web application testing

📱 Mortgage Calculator App – Mobile application testing

🌐 Grafana API – REST API testing

🖥️ Electron App – Desktop framework testing

🧮 Windows Calculator – Native Windows application testing

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks Used:

🗄️ MySQL (Free Online DB) – Used for login validation on the Grafana web page

🔧 Jenkins – For automated test execution and CI pipeline integration

🌐 REST Assured – For REST API automation and validation

📊 Allure Reports – For rich test reporting with screenshots and detailed logs

## ⚠ Known Limitations:

⚠ Dependency Conflicts: Since this project integrates multiple types of applications and tools, occasional dependency conflicts may arise.

🧪 This project is intended for demonstration purposes only.

🧩 In a production environment, the framework should be divided into separate, modular projects based on application type or testing layer for better maintainability and scalability.
